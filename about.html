		      <div class="collapsible-body"><p> I started looking into becoming a developer when I was working at a company called Lincoln Financial Advisors. It was when my boss asked me to take a look at his company website. I wanted to figure out a way to make his website better on my own, so I started googling ways to do so and found <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/TSTEAD">Codeacademy.com</a>. It really helped me get the basics down of HTML, CSS, Javascript, and some other websites as well.</p></div>

		      <div class="collapsible-body"><p>Next I moved to work for a company called Carlisle and Gallagher. There I found the opportunity to work on lots of different tools made with Visual Basic for Application, and continued self teaching outsdie of work. Mostly with the help of <a href="http://www.udacity.com/">Udacity.com</a> I looked into things like android app development, some java, and some python. I really enjoyed teaching myself new technologies, and wanted to keep growing.</p></div>

		      <div class="collapsible-body"><p>Most recently, I completed the Tech Talent South<a href="http://techtalentsouth.com/courses/code-immersion/"> Boot Camp</a> and learned a lot about Ruby on Rails! It was a ton of fun and I had a great time. The most impressive thing that was built from that was our app <a href = "https://ugiftme.herokuapp.com/"> UGiftme</a>. It was a ton of great experience and is something that I intend to continue working on as I grow as a developer.

      <div class="collapsible-header"><i class="material-icons">filter_drama</i>Family</div>
      <div class="collapsible-body"><p> I have a beautiful wife of 3 years. She is very good to me and works as a social worker here in Richardson. We both have family all over Texas, and are very close with them. I have a 7 year old dog named Odie who is a black lab/golden retriever mix. He is awesome and very smart. I joke that he is a computer science dog due to him being lazy/efficient when it comes to playing and using energy. We also have a cat named Eevee who is great at killing bugs and can play fetch with nerf guns! I think she wants to be a dog as well.

      <div class="collapsible-header"><i class="material-icons">place</i>Fun</div>
      <div class="collapsible-body"><p> In my "spare" time, my wife and I like to run and do races together This year we are doing the Savage race, last year we ran a half marathon, and we typically do the turkey trot every year. We like adventure and will go outside with odie or just to do fun things. I played Ultimate frisbee in college and enjoy doing that on a semi regular basis. I love video games, board games, hanging out with friends, and watching basketball or football of any type, as well as baseball and hockey. Big fan of the Celtics, Packers, Stars and Rangers. I would like to get more into soccer and MMA, but am a pretty busy person. Maybe you can help?!

      <div class="collapsible-header"><i class="material-icons">whatshot</i>Faith</div>
      <div class="collapsible-body"><p>
My faith is very important to me, and it wouldn't be painting a good picture of me if I didn't include it. I attend <a href = "www.watermark.org">Watermark Community Church</a> on a regular basis. I have a community group there of 5 married couples that I meet with weekly, I help with the tech crew on things like running slides for worship or camera, and in the future would like to help with the merge ministry. I aslo serve at Richardson High's <a href = "http://www.richardsonareayounglife.com/richardson/"> Young Life </a> group co-leading the class of 2018 guys. They are a handful, but I think its very important to be intentional with the future of our country and to help guide them through the confusingness that is high school.
